In the ever-evolving world of body art, a unique player emerged in 2015, transforming the way we think about tattoos. Inkbox, founded by brothers Tyler and Braden Handley, introduced a novel concept: semi-permanent tattoos that change as you do. The idea was born out of a common dilemma—wanting a tattoo but not the lifelong commitment. This sparked a journey to Panama, where they discovered a fruit used by locals to dye their skin. This discovery was the genesis of Inkbox's For Now Ink™, a semi-permanent tattoo that fades over time.

The success of Inkbox lies not just in its innovative product but in its commitment to artistic expression, sustainability, and community. By collaborating with artists worldwide, Inkbox offers an extensive collection of designs, ensuring that everyone finds a way to express their unique story. Moreover, the brand has made strides in ensuring its operations give back to the communities and environments it draws inspiration from.

## Why Choose Semi-Permanent Tattoos?
Semi-permanent tattoos offer a unique opportunity for self-expression without permanence. They're perfect for:

Experimentation: Trying out designs before committing to a permanent tattoo.
Flexibility: Changing your tattoos as your style evolves.
No Regrets: Enjoying tattoos without the worry of future regret.
Inkbox has become more than just a tattoo company; it's a movement towards a more flexible and forgiving form of self-expression.

## The Future of Inkbox
With over a million tattoos shipped worldwide, Inkbox continues to innovate and inspire. The Handley brothers' vision has grown into a thriving community of artists and customers who share a love for tattoos and the stories they tell. As Inkbox looks to the future, it remains dedicated to pushing the boundaries of how we express ourselves, making tattoos accessible, and sustainable for all.
